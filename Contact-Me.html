<h1>Some msg from ur Ravi Sir</h1>
<p>  Debarati do </p>

<p>  Debarati do u know my level of tolerance, but i never discussed these things to u bcz thinking u may think it's my ego. I quotes my life was always a happy never had any complaints from lord, but do u know the other deep side of it, why it was always a happy. Bcz i too had many difficulties in my life but i always felt lord never gave me any trouble which i cannot bear, and later on i felt even those trouble was like some artificial difficulty created by him to make me stronger.
In 2nd yr when i decided that i may be dedicating my life for higher cause & may be never entering and relationship, u know afterwards i completely ignored any personal talks with any girl. Surely never denied any help but no personal talk.
Debarati in class 8 only i took commitment of not using many things which even now i follows. U know behind these commitments I was not influenced by any organisation. Infact i came to know abt iskcon in clg.
Do u know my level to bear the pain, if it really hurts someone i can really take commitment to never contact them even if it may take my life. But my other side, even if i can sense the person in any repentance i will not hesitate to break my any commitment so that the person shouldn't feel guilty. Not just u, i don't want anyone should feel guilty, bcz i am always ready to have people with open heart without any ego.

Its my extreme desire to talk with u but i can really bear not to talk with u, if anyway u r hurted. But do u know my love for u also had some tinge of parental feelings & if i can sense u in any pain then trust me this is the thing which may really kill me. I really even in worst nightmare also don't wants to see u in any trouble. I searched for u a lot on FB but couldn't find, though even not knowing ur mother's name but don't know how it came in my friend suggestion list. But few days back Debolina name also came in friend suggestion list, i was shocked and hurted too to see her name, though i never searched for it. Debolina blocked me without responding to any of my msg on insta. Though i thought let me deactivate my FB only bcz i may try to create another trouble for u. U know the difficulty to deactivate it. Debarati after 2014 i never uploaded any photo on it, but yes only last year after being in love with u, thinking u may be watching. Not just this Debarati my every insta post also had a strong desire to be liked by u but u never responded. Debarati u hided ur insta story in very early, don't u feels people like me so sensitive to not hurt anyone, how i will feel like when indirectly stamped with such actions. Not just this u kept blocking me time to time.

U know i am the person of so much of etiquette and values, before thinking of marrying u, i even consulted senior iskcon devotee and explained everything regarding my feelings for u, he assured me there is nothing wrong and it's possible from social and cultural perspective. And i am not giving any irresponsible statements, i am capable enough to take all responsibility regarding u, but don't misunderstand me when i quotes such things, i never means that u r not strong enough to take ur own responsibility. But out of love i will be happy to do so. U know Debarati i will not be complaining anytime for even type and taste of food, only there r some resticted things which i don't want to be cooked but will never be complaining for those things. Pls understand my mindset i am the person who really can compromise a lot and even did manytimes in my life, but surely will not compromise if it hurts anyone or anyone's feelings.
Debarati i deactivated my FB account first time since i created, but do u know i couldn't delete my small insta acc, 2nd telegram, 2nd whatsapp bcz though bcz of u only i deactivated but i never wanted u should feel guilty, so i couldn't delete these acc buz u know about it.

But pls don't feel low Debarati i really deeply loves u. I am not saying this to get u back in my life as a conjugal lover but still someone who really has genuine love.

And if really u don't know how to deal with scenario whether u ever tried contacting ur Ravi sir, do u feels he will give u any wrong guidance? I said na every limbs of my body still aspires to see u happy though every blocking by u was like getting thrown in death well again and again.

Debarati i have capacity to bear infinite pain and sufferings but still i always took initiative to talk with u, so pls try understanding there is no hidden agenda but i know in my life experience there is nothing more important than true love. Pls don't kill ur inner self by getting influenced by so called Bollywood and Hollywood celebrities. People getting influenced by them really started underestimating the power of love, many believes these r just chemical secretion and thus society is losing feelings. True love can move mountains but true love really means to have infinite love and trust. Though society and values of relationship is degrading day by day, still i can guarantee if u can trust me our relationship will be much more stronger than  bwn any exemplary couple relationship u witnessed in families. U know Debarati even after in love with u, i never thought of discussing anything sensual but very eagerly wanted to know ur nature, bcz i knew these r the area if one invest with genuine love and sacrifice the relationship not just only withstand any calamity but be a cause unlimited happiness, motivation and what not.



But pls trust me Debarati   </p>
